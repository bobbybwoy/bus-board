# Bus Board

This exercise uses two APIs, `api.postcode.io/postcodes` and `api.tfl.gov.uk/StopPoint`.

1. The first part was to determine the next five buses from a specific bus stop (`busBoard.js`)

2. The second part was to determine the two nearest bus stops from a specific postcode and to provide directions, if required (`busStops.js`)

3. The third part was to provide a journey planner from one postcode to another postcode (`journeyPlanner.js`)

Much of the work was done in collaboration with Ruksan Emirali.
